# QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

1. Do people living in apartments pay less on electricity than those living in houses? (adjust for number of bedrooms and number of occupants)
2. How much does each group pay? 



# MISSINGNESS

## ACR and VALP both have many null values, 2586 and 4632 respectively. Analysis in the *TBD* section will determine how the missingness is distributed.

```{r EXPLORE DATA}
i = 1
names <- names(df)
  
for( col in df) {
  #print(paste(col.names(), sum(is.na(col))))
  print(paste(names[i], "Has", sum(is.na(col)), "nulls"))
  i <- i + 1
}

```
